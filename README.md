# Survival Rate Analysis of Titanic Passengers

As the final project of the [Udacity's Intro to Data Analysis Course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud170), I conducted an exploratory data analysis on the available passenger information and tried to find correlations between passenger data and their survival rates. This analysis uses pandas library.

## Data source

The data was provided by Udacity in a [CSV file](https://www.udacity.com/api/nodes/5454512672/supplemental_media/titanic-datacsv/download) and the actual source is the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
